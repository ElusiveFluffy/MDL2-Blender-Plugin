# MDL2-Blender-Plugin
Plugin for blender to import and export MDL2 from Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 1

To install the plugin just put the mdl2 folder in the blender add-ons folder usually located at this directory C:\Users\\*YourPCsName*\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.93\scripts\addons, then in blender go to Edit>Preferences>Add-ons then search for the mdl2 tool plugin and enable it, now there should be new import and export options. To quickly get to the roaming folder you can just type %appdata% into the search bar near the start menu.

There is also a custom collision panel to be able to easily select collision types, and even supports custom ones that you can add to the global.mad file
